# KickStarter_Challenge1

## Overview of Project: Explain Purpose

-The purpose  of this analysis is to identify how the launch month or fundraising goal amounts relates to the outcomes of successful, failed, or canceled crowdsourcing campaigns. 

## Analysis and Challenges
-Running excel pivot or graphs are not difficult, but to match with the outcome exactly matching by the rublic was a challege.  Reading thoughly for the direction was helpful to get right chart and pivot table. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
-See Kickstarter_Challenge.xlsx and "Theater Outcomes by Launch Date" tab.
-see Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
-See Kickstarter_Challenge.xlsx and "Outcomes Based on Goals" tab.
-See Outcomes_vs_Goals.png.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Running excel pivot or graphs are not difficult, but to match with the outcome exactly matching by the rublic was a challege.  Reading thoughly for the direction was helpful to get right chart and pivot table. 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
1) Successful rate was high when theater was launched in May and June.
2) Successful rate and failed rate have corelationship when successful rate went up, failed rate was went up except the month of December. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
1) Fundraising goal amounts were small then successful rate was high because it was achivable. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
1)There are outliers in the dataset that will drive mean value high, so in order to get more relevant dataset, these will need to be removed. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
1) Calculate the standard deviation, mean value, , and quartiles.  Also create the box plots to visualize these values and outliers in the dataset.
